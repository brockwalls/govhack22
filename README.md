## Govhack22 Project for Public Transport  

This project aims to used both ABS and ACT supplied data to improve sustainable behaviours around the use of public transport in the ACT.

The TransCO2 website does this by approaching the uptake, CO2 output and Pricing of the ACT's public transport usage from two sides.
The first being the side of the commuter and the second being the side of the transport planner.

To start using the TransCO2 Website from a Commuter Preceptive please click [here](user.md)
The planners side of the Website is [here](Planner_veiw.md)

### Introduction of a Mobile Site
Whilst the TransCO2 does work on mobile in the current state with further developments a specific mobile app could be developed.
Some screenshots of this potential app can be seen below.
